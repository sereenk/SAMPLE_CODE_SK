# LHS 712: Natural Language Processing in Health(NLP, Python, R)

## INTRODUCTION
Course Description: Students in this course will learn advanced techniques to parse and collate information from text-rich health documents such as electronic health records, clinical notes, and peer-reviewed medical literature. In this elective, students will be able to delve deeper into challenges in recognizing medical entities in text documents, extracting clinical information, addressing ambiguity and polysemy, and building searchable interfaces to efficiently and effectively query and retrieve relevant patient data. Students will develop tools and techniques to analyze new genres of health information and build resources to help in these tasks. Students will also participate in a semester-long project on addressing specific natural language processing challenges in real-life health data sets.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By completion of the course, students will be able to:
