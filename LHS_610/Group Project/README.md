# Does Undernourishment and Nutrition affect Covid-19 Mortality Rate?

## The Datasets
In this dataset, we combined data of food, undernourished rate and global COVID-19
cases information from around the world in order to learn more about how a country’s food
supply correlates with the COVID fatality rate. The datasets we used are listed below.
● Dataset 1: New Food Balances Data (2018) [10]
● Dataset 2: Suite of Food Security Indicators (2018) [10]
Dataset 1 and 2 are originally obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations (FAO website). The data contains food, agriculture and related information for over 245
countries. FAO’s goal is to achieve food security for all populations and make sure everyone
can have regular access to enough high-quality food and live healthy [10]. Those datasets were
collected to shape development plans and end hunger. Thus, one of the valuable works for FAO
is collecting, analyzing and interpreting food and agriculture statistics for relevant
decision-making.
● COVID-19 Dataset from John Hopkins [11]
Our third dataset is obtained from Johns Hopkins University. They track how the novel
coronavirus is spreading around the globe with up-to-date visuals. Their website “provides
resources to help advance the understanding of the virus, inform the public, and brief
policymakers in order to guide a response, improve care, and save lives. [11]”.
Undernourishment is the exposure variable and COVID mortality is the outcome variable
we plan to look at. Undernourishment rates are calculated by the number of cases divided by
the country's population and fatality ratios are the number of deaths divided by the number of
confirmed cases. The global hide inequalities within countries and the countries which face
insufficient food and nutrition access may be affected more by the present COVID pandemic.
We have reasons to believe that the higher undernourishment rate may indicate the higher
COVID mortality rate.
The first confounder in our analysis is the energy intake (kcal) from different types of
food in countries around the world (food supply). The undernourishment measures the share of
population which has a caloric intake which is insufficient to meet the minimum energy
requirements [13]. Thus, the average energy intake across countries should closely relate to its
malnutrition situation. As we know, calories are important to protect against breakdown of
muscle for energy. People need more calories than their normal diet to mount an immune
response with an infection. Thus, energy intake would potentially affect the COVID worsen or
recovery. Similarly, our second potential confounder --- the average protein intake (protein
supply) plays an important role when it comes to malnutrition and COVID mortality. There are
different types of undernourishment: protein-energy malnutrition and dietary deficiencies [14].
Because of taking unhealthy food, a person may also suffer from malnutrition. “Efforts to
improve nutrition are some of the most effective forms of development aid [14]”. Protein is as
important as calories when protecting against muscle loss while fighting COVID-19, especially if
the patients are bedridden or inactive [15]. These two variables obviously relate to
undernourishment rate to some extent. Even though these two variables may not directly lead to
the death of COVID patients, adequate energy and protein intake during the illness may be
linked to decreased mortality.

## Conclusions
Our analysis showed no relationship between undernourishment rate and fatality rate. It
was expected to see a decrease in case fatality rates as food supply and protein supply
increased. However, the analysis showed no relationship between food supply or protein supply
with case fatality rate. But, we did see a relationship between undernourishment and food
supply. Countries with higher food supply showed a lower undernourishment rate. Additionally,
we noticed similar relationships between different levels of protein supply and undernourishment
rate. Even though most of our analysis was inconclusive, we were able to understand the
impact of food and nutrition on a person’s health. For the future, we would have to look into
specific data by age group and more updated information for the year 2020-21 in order for us to
analyze the relationship between the variables.
