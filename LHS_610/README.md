# LHS 610: Exploratory Data Analysis in Health ( R Programming)

## INTRODUCTION
Real health data is complex, often unstructured, at times inaccurate, inconsistent, contains missing values, and is organized for clinical care rather than to meet analytic needs. Learning from health data requires a solid grasp of data operations, data visualization, statistics, and machine learning, as well as an understanding of ethical and legal frameworks guiding health data privacy and security. Students in this course will learn foundational topics in data science focused on health data and will apply this knowledge on real health datasets through hands-on labs integrated into the lectures. The course is based on two large themes: (a) understanding health data, and (b) making inferences based on data. Students will develop a systematic working understanding of R, one of the most widely used languages for data science, and an introductory understanding of several packages useful in analyzing health data. They will participate in a group project focused on answering a health-related question. After completing this course, students should be able to securely store a health data set, summarize its structure, merge tables, visualize relationships, reshape and subset it to meet analytic needs, deal with missing values, apply statistical and machine learning methods to build prediction models, and evaluate the performance of these models. 

## COURSE OBJECTIVES

Define the challenges of working with health data, including legal and methodological issues pertaining to the secondary use of clinical data.
Describe the features of a health-related question that make it important and answerable, including data sources that can be leveraged to address it.
Apply “data verbs” and visualization to identify data quality issues and describe important relationships between clinical features and health outcomes.
Apply machine learning methods to develop and validate predictive models to answer a health-related question.
Discuss strategies for working with big data and speeding up data analysis
